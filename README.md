# FINGERPRINT-BASED-BLOOD-GROUP-DETECTION-USING-CNN-
 Just completed my project on Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Detection using CNN!  🔍 In this machine learning project, I used:  🧠 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  🧬 8000 fingerprint samples  ☁️ Dataset stored on Google Cloud  ✅ Trained using 80% data and validated on 20% 📈 Compared CNN with KNN and ANN
